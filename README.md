# Simple drag'n'rotate widget

I used a bunch of pre-rendered pictures of the glove. Added them effect of smooth rotation and some flying blocks around.

To run project, please, clone repo. Then

> cd rotator
> npm i
> npm build
> npm start

And check result on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Thank you
